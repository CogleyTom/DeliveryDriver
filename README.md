# DeliveryDriver
Computer Game developed with Unity that allows a user to control a car and pick up packages and deliver them

## Purpose
The purpose of this game is to control a car to pick up packages.  Once a package is picked up it must be delivered.  This game is not challenging, there is no way to lose.  This game was made to be relaxing and not competitive or stressful.

## How to Play
This game is played on a computer using a keyboard.  The car is controlled by using the arrows.  When the user presses the up-arrow the car speeds up, when the down-arrow is pressed the car slows down.  The car is rotated by using the left and right arrow keys.  The user controls the car to pick up a package represented by green small squares.  When the car picks up a package the car changes its color to green, representing holding a package.  The user can only hold one package at a time.  They must bring it to the delivery point represented by the blue square.  When the package is delivered the car turns back to it's blue color.  If the user runs into an object on the map the car slows down in speed.  If the user runs over a booster represented by the yellow circles the car speeds up.
